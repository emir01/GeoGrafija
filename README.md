# GeoGrafija

## Personal Archives "Project"

This is a very old repository containg code written about 7 years ago! So I don't remember  much about  it :)

It was written as part of my graduation paper and here are some points:

1. It was meant as an interactive web application to teach kids Geography
2. It has Google Maps - Even back then I loved Maps and chose a project to support that.
3. Teachers and Students could log into the system.
4. Teaches could create tests/questions and the system would generate tests for students to take.
5. It tried to gamify students exploration and quiz taking.
6. **IT HAS UNIT TESTS** :D - A lot more that it needs to have!

Safe to say this readme is going to be a short one!
